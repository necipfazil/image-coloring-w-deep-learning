## Image coloring based on deep learning

An image coloring solution that:
* Given color images, trains a neural network,
* Given grayscale images, produces color image estimations using the trained neural network.

The implementation is mainly based on the python machine learning library: [PyTorch](pytorch.org).

Prepared as an adhoc implementation.
